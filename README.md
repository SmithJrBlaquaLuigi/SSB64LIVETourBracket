# **Super Smash Bros 64 Live Tournament Bracket Online**

This live bracket represents the tournament for Smash Bros 64 and organize players in the bracket on the application and the website. It can also be used to control players on the bracket from the beginning to an end during the tournament. 
Keep in mind that this project is currently in the works at the moment. If you're willing to fork this repo to make changes on your own repo, **PLEASE** ask me beforehand. 

Connecting with the cilent online for sharing controls on the bracket may be implemented in the future.
Also, if you're gonna mess with it, beware of bugs since it's pretty new, and it may not function properly. It is not recommended to do so anyway, but I'll leave it up to you.
